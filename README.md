# Sowingo Front-End Challenge

An angularJS interview test seed

### Challenge

We've got two mocked up REST endpoints, one for a list of products and one for altering products' favorite status.

Your challenge is to work on this seed project to fetch the list of products and display them on a template according to this [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/cwdrJAjr9k8HbNpVCTlSPy/Sowingo_Marketplace_Test) and:

- display all listed products
- add to and remove from cart with bubble update (locally, no endpoint for that) 
- make changes to favorite status and keep state changes in memory
- filter list in real time through the search input on top
- filter for favorites or on-cart items (ie. when clicking favorites or cart)

Bonus points if you can also:
- use a CSS pre-processor such as LESS or SASS (you choose, but commit both source and compiled files if you do)
- make it responsive (you can find pre-made classes on the libs included)
